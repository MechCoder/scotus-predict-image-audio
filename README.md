## Can lawyer image and voice features improve a Supreme Court prediction model?  

Our work is inspired by an existing supreme court prediction model, https://github.com/mjbommar/scotus-predict/.
We generate ratings for the various facial and voice traits Supreme Court advocates. 
For details, see the **audio_features** and **image_features** subdirectories.
Please note that many of these scripts are not reproducible without non-public data, sorry.

The feature importances obtained in this analysis are shown below (we can see that how a lawyer sounds and looks is associated with Supreme Court decisions).
