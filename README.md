# Does how a lawyer talk and look influence Supreme Court predictions?

We propose to answer this question in our work inspired by the existing supreme court prediction
model https://github.com/mjbommar/scotus-predict/.
We generate ratings on the various facial traits and voice traits of different lawyers by different methods
described in the **audio_features** and **image_features** subdirectories.
Note that the scripts are not reproducible without the data and we are bound by an agreement to not share
the data.

Here are the feature importances that we get from the analysis. From the graphs, how a lawyer talks and
looks does have an influence on the supreme court predictions.
